# ILI 9225

The primary reference for this driver was [Tom Vijlbrief's script for driving the screen via netcat][tomtor], as well as [Microyum's fork of the driver that inspired Tom][microyum].

I've been underwhelmed by the level of deatil in the comments of either source, so I'll be supplementing my code with the documentation from [v0.22 of the Datasheet][datasheet], which is marked as "Preliminary" but appears to be the latest version of the documentation for this device available.
